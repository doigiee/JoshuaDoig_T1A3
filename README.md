Brainstormed ideas, submitted this one, got it appoved, created file on linux wsl linked to VScode, setup a virtual environment (venv.), git init,  git add . , git commit -m 'Inital Commit', and git push to my github repository as JoshuaDoig_T1A3. Then finished my flowchart and setup a Trello to track progress.
# Day 2 FRIDAY
Following my flowchart, began making pseudocode on main.py, functions and imports can be added and sorted out later. Basically creating bare bones and skeleton as '#' comments so that all will be left to do is figure out the code. (Had house inspection today so was busy for 2/3 of the day).
